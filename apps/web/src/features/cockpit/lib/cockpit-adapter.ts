/**
 * The JS/TS boundary around the Agent Viewer WASM module.
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE EXISTS: nothing else in the frontend may touch raw generated
 * WASM bindings. The generated API changes shape whenever the Rust ABI does;
 * that churn stops here.
 *
 * # The rule this file enforces
 *
 * A cursor position is NEVER computed as `caseSequence / lastCaseSequence`. One
 * Canonical Event compiles to zero renderer entries (`usage.recorded`), one
 * (`tool.requested`), or several (an allowed `gateway.routed`), so the ratio is
 * wrong by an amount nothing measures. Every translation is a Render Manifest
 * lookup, in both directions.
