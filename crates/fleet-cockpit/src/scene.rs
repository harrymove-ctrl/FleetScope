//! Loading a compiled Case into the Zoetrope renderer.
//!
//! This is the seam between FleetScope's Scenario Compiler and the vendored
//! rendering substrate. It is deliberately thin: the fold, the timeline engine,
//! the graph projection and the camera are Zoetrope's and stay unmodified, so
//! its 182 upstream tests keep their meaning. What lives here is the FleetScope
//! side of the contract — which artifacts make up a scene, and what a snapshot of
//! one says.
//!
//! # Host-testable on purpose
//!
//! Nothing in this module touches `ratzilla`, `wasm-bindgen` or a browser. The
//! Zoetrope dependency is its PORTABLE CORE (`default-features = false`), which
//! builds and runs on the host. That is what makes it possible to prove — in an
//! ordinary `cargo test` — that a compiled Case really does fold into the graph
//! and timeline FleetScope claims it does, rather than discovering it in a
//! browser after a wasm build.
